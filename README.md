# JavaScript Practice Repository  

Welcome to my **JavaScript Practice Repository**, where I have extensively practiced and explored JavaScript concepts. This repository is a collection of categorized folders, progressively structured from basics to professional-level concepts. Each folder contains detailed exercises, notes, and code implementations.

## üóÇÔ∏è Repository Structure  

The repository is divided into **four levels** based on complexity and topics:  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Basics**  
The fundamentals of JavaScript are covered in this section, focusing on building a strong foundation:  
- **Variables**: var, let, const, and variable scoping.  
- **Data Types**: Understanding primitives (string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol) and non-primitives (objects, arrays).  
- **Summary**: Key takeaways and cheat sheets for quick revision.  
- **Stack and Heap Memory**: Insights into how JavaScript manages memory allocation.  
- **App Memory**: Memory management and garbage collection concepts.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Intermediate**  
This section dives deeper into commonly used features of JavaScript:  
- **Strings**: String methods and manipulations.  
- **Numbers**: Working with numbers and the `Math` object.  
- **Dates**: Handling dates using the `Date` object and formatting them.  
- **Arrays**: Basics of arrays and working with multi-dimensional arrays.  
- **Array Functions**: Detailed study of array methods like `push()`, `pop()`, `shift()`, `unshift()`, `slice()`, `splice()`.  
- **Objects**: Object creation, manipulation, and advanced techniques.  
- **JSON**: Understanding JSON structure and methods (`JSON.stringify()`, `JSON.parse()`).  
- **Functions**: From basic function declarations to advanced topics like callbacks, function expressions, and default parameters.  
- **Advanced Functions**: Higher-order functions, function chaining, and dynamic function creation.  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Advanced**  
This section covers JavaScript concepts essential for advanced developers:  
- **Scope**: Block, function, and lexical scope.  
- **Hoisting**: How JavaScript moves declarations during execution.  
- **Arrow Functions**: Syntax, behavior, and use cases.  
- **IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions)**: Purpose and applications.  
- **Call Stack**: Understanding the stack for function execution.  
- **Control Flow**: Conditional statements and loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`).  
- **Higher-Order Array Methods**: Detailed coverage of `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`, and `find()`.  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Professional**  
The final level focuses on advanced topics and professional practices in JavaScript:  
- **Events**: Event handling and propagation (`addEventListener`, bubbling, and capturing).  
- **Async Programming**: Asynchronous JavaScript with callbacks, promises, and `async/await`.  
- **Promise Handling**: Implementing promises with both `then/catch` and `try/catch`.  
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**:  
  - **Classes**: ES6 classes, constructors, inheritance, and static methods.  
  - **Prototypes**: Prototypal inheritance and chaining.  
  - **Call & Bind**: Function borrowing and method binding.  
- **Object Properties**: Managing writable, enumerable, and configurable properties.  
- **Getters and Setters**: Encapsulation with accessor properties.  
- **Closures**: Understanding closures and their use cases in real-world applications.  
- **Advanced Arrays**:  
  - Array types: Continuous arrays vs holy arrays.  
  - Performance considerations for different array structures.
